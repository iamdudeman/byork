# Byork

This is a reimplementation the text based adventure game Zork. This project was to fulfill the project 2 requirement for my Software Engineering course in 2015. It was later uploaded here to GitHub.

This was a joint effort between me and [@BrintMontgomery](https://github.com/BrintMontgomery) though there is no commit history since it was not originally developed on GitHub.
